# API Reference

**Base URL:** https://ammawallet.com
**Interactive Docs:** [https://ammawallet.com/docs](https://ammawallet.com/docs)

The backend exposes 82 REST API endpoints organized into 14 categories. All endpoints return JSON. Protected endpoints require a JWT bearer token in the Authorization header.

## Authentication

Obtain tokens by posting credentials to the login endpoint. The response includes an access token (15-minute expiry) and a refresh token (7-day expiry). Include the access token in subsequent requests as Authorization: Bearer <token>. When the access token expires, use the refresh endpoint to obtain a new pair. API keys can also be used via the x-api-key header for programmatic access.

## Rate Limits

All endpoints are subject to a global rate limit of 100 requests per minute per IP. Authentication endpoints (login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, change-password) have a stricter limit of 10 requests per 5 minutes. Rate limit headers are included in every response: x-ratelimit-limit, x-ratelimit-remaining, and x-ratelimit-reset.

## Error Format

All errors return a JSON object with an error field containing a human-readable message. HTTP status codes follow standard conventions: 400 for validation errors, 401 for missing or invalid authentication, 403 for forbidden actions or invalid PIN, 404 for not found, 409 for conflicts (e.g., duplicate email), 429 for rate limit exceeded, and 500 for internal server errors.

## Example: Login Flow

Send a POST request to /api/v1/auth/login with a JSON body containing email, password, and turnstileToken fields. On success without 2FA, the response includes accessToken, refreshToken, and user object. If 2FA is enabled, the first response returns requiresTwoFactor: true with tempToken and methods array. Send a second POST to the same endpoint with email, password, twoFactorCode, twoFactorMethod, and tempToken to complete authentication.

## Example: Token List with Pagination

Send a GET request to /api/v1/tokens?sortBy=rating&limit=10&offset=0. The response includes a tokens array of token objects (each with assetCode, assetIssuer, tomlName, ratingAverage, image, and other metadata) and a pagination object with total (e.g., 342), limit (10), offset (0), and hasMore (true). Verified tokens include a resolved image URL pointing to self-hosted icons at /assets/icons/.

## Example: MoneyGram Deposit

Send a POST request to /api/v1/moneygram/deposit with a JSON body containing publicKey (the user's Stellar public key) and optionally amount (USD value). The server performs SEP-10 authentication with MoneyGram using the server signing key, then initiates a SEP-24 interactive deposit. The response includes transactionId, interactiveUrl (open in browser for KYC and payment), and type. After the user completes the flow at a MoneyGram location, poll GET /api/v1/moneygram/transaction/:id to check for completion.

## Example: Liquidity Pool Deposit

Send a GET request to /api/v1/earn/pools to browse available pools. Select a pool and send a POST request to /api/v1/earn/deposit with publicKey, poolId, maxAmountA, and maxAmountB. The server returns unsigned XDR. Sign the XDR client-side (self-custody) or via POST /api/v1/transactions/sign (delegated mode), then submit via POST /api/v1/transactions/submit. Check your positions at GET /api/v1/earn/positions/:publicKey.
